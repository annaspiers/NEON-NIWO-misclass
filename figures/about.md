**Brainstorming 10 Aug 2020**  

1. [X] Theta confusion matrix (Visualizing misclassification)   

2. Prior and posterior density for Theta  
    * Density plots (colors correspond to prior, full model, reduced model)  
    * Differences in means/medians  
        * Consider the added value of full occupancy model vs just misclass model  
        * Heat map of posterior differences between two confusion matrices  
        * Scatterplot of median theta values (x-axis full, y-axis reduced) with a one to one line (color by whether the point is along a diagonal/”correct” species ID prob. Or is a non-diagonal element)  
    * Differences in precision  
        * Scatterplot of 95% CI widths (x-axis full, y-axis reduced)  
        * Heatmap of 95% CI widths or posterior standard deviations (or a heatmap of differences or ratios in CI widths)  
        
3. Something summarizing occupancy dynamics  
    * Maybe some covariate effect (potentially soil moisture?)  
    * Time-series of estimated occupancy probability by species  
    
4. Conceptual figure/overview approach  
    * [X] NEON data collection -> parataxonomist IDs/counting -> expert taxonomist IDs (subset) 
    * [X] DAG
