Also see [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Todaiop6BTS8-CipZFkF9vwBUECzHxKn) for Sarah's list of signature datasets.


No tutorial is needed to use Niwot LTER data but it's handy to know at the bottom of each data package on the web there is a code snippet to read the data into R/python/matlab/SAS/SPSS etc. For example, click here https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-nwt.5.2 and see "code generation".
