# What are our science questions? 

Large-scale, long-term community data collection is important for tracking biodiversity patterns

Error is necessarily part of the collection process

# What are our science questions? 

Large-scale, long-term community data collection is important for tracking biodiversity patterns

Error is necessarily part of the collection process   

How can we probabilistically capture identification error in an imperfect species classifier at a large-scale with limited validation data?

What does the dynamic occupancy model contribute to the misclassification model?

# What are the data like? 
### Site

Our focus is on ground beetles (aka carabids) at the NEON Niwot Ridge site

---

# What are the data like? 
### Data processing

NEON collects carabids in pitfall traps at every terrestrial site

# What are the data like? 
### Data at Niwot Ridge

<center><img src="figs/processingatniwot.png" width="70%" class="center"><center>
  
???
Using data from 2015-2018 since lag in expert identifications is 600 days
---

# What are the data like? 
### Discrepancies in IDs
<center><img src="figs/IDdiscrepancy.png" width="80%"></center>

???
high-level visual
all individuals that were ID'ed by an expert
dot size corresponds to number of individuals
red dots are discrepancies between parataxonomist and individual taxonomist IDs

---

# What is our model approach?  

<center><img src="figs/dag.png" width="80%" class="center">
</center>
???
The imperfect classification (y_ijlt) is a random variable controlled by the partially observed true identification (k_ijlt) and the probabilistic categorical distribution of identifications for species k. L_ijt is the total number of indiviuals encountered, driven by the expected encounter rate, lambda, and the true occupancy state, z. The occupancy state is driven by occupancy parameters psi, phi, and gamma.... prob of occupancy, survival, and colonization.

# What do our model results look like?  
### Theta confusion matrix

---

# What do our model results look like?  
### Prior and posterior density for Theta 
<center><img src="figs/thetadifference.png" width="85%" class="center">
</center>
???
Heat map of posterior differences between two confusion matrices  

---

# What do our model results look like?  
### Prior and posterior density for Theta 
<center><img src="figs/comparedensities.png" width="60%" class="center"></center>
???
This compares the density plots of theta prior, theta from the full dynamic occupancy model, and theta from the reduced misclass-only model

# What do our model results look like?  
### Prior and posterior density for Theta 
<center><img src="figs/CIwidthcomparison.png" width="60%" class="center">
</center>
???
this figure comapres the differences in precisiion between the full and reduced model
compare 95% CI widths (x-axis full, y-axis reduced)
We see greater credible interval widths in the full model compared to the corresponding recuded model

# What do our model results look like?  
### Occupancy dynamics

# What do our model results look like?  
### Occupancy dynamics: site-level random effects

# What do our model results look like?

# What are the takeaways and why is this exciting? 
* This contributes to improving identifiability of misclassification models
* This probabilistic model is directly helpful for users of NEON carabid data
* Unexplored: opportunity to explore limits of model identifiability using simulated data

???
Unexplored... play with the 'percent known species' threshold to understand how much validation we need for model identifiability
