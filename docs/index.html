Notes for the _first_ slide!

# Agenda

1. What are our science questions? 
2. What are the data like? 
3. What is our model approach?  
4. What do our model results look like?  
5. What are the takeaways and why is this exciting?

# What are our science questions? 

Large-scale, long-term community data collection is important for tracking biodiversity patterns, but error is necessarily part of the collection process.   

How can we probabilistically capture identification error in an imperfect species classifier at a large-scale with limited validation data?  

How does the misclassification model change when integrated into the occupancy model?

# What are the data like? 
Site

Our focus is on ground beetles (aka carabids) at the NEON Niwot Ridge site

# What are the data like? 
Data processing

NEON collects carabids in pitfall traps at every terrestrial site
