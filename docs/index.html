# Agenda

1. What are our science questions? 
2. What do are our data like? 
3. What is our model approach?  
4. What do our model results look like?  
5. What are the takeaways and why is this exciting?

# What are our science questions? 

Large-scale, long-term community data collection is important for tracking biodiversity patterns, but error is necessarily part of the collection process.   

How can we probabilistically capture identification error in an imperfect species classifier at a large-scale with limited validation data?  

How does the misclassification model change when integrated into the occupancy model?

# What do are our data like? 

NEON collects ground beetles (aka carabids) in pitfall traps at every terrestrial site

Our focus is on carabid data at the Niwot Ridge site
