## Accessing NEON data
There are two ways to access NEON data
1) Via the API ([Application Programming Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface))\
   https://data.neonscience.org/data-api
2) Via the portal (web browser)\

In either case, you'll probably want the NEON-utilities (NEON's R package for working with their data; Install from within R or Python)\
